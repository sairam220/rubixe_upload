        <p className="service-description">
          IoT has a phenomenal potential as a technology in shaping every aspect
          of human life from productivity, convenience, luxury to
          sustainability. IoT concepts were popular for more than a decade but,
          thanks to technologies such as Big Data, BlockChain, AI, and Machine
          Learning, IoT has found a vast market â€“ projected to be $ 11 trillion
          y 2025. In the next 2 years, it is expected that about 50 billion
          devices will be connected, which is about 7 times the entire human
          population on earth. The founding team of Rubixe has been working in
          IoT solutions since 2008 for European Union and large European
          customers, through which Rubixe gained a vast knowledge base in IoT
          solutions delivery. Not sure how IoT can help or impact your business?
